Just find the union of queries so 0,1 and 0,2 we can swap any from 0,1,2 so on sorting this we would get lex smallest string, first put all swap index in sets based on the common leader after this we are going to have some components , we iterate through sring for each index we find its parent and put the character in map so that we can identify that element with particular parent belong to which set
